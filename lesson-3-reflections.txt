When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

It would be particularly useful when I'm working with other people. This allows us
to be on the same page and make changes concurrently and more efficiently. It would
also be good in case of system failure as a copy of my repository will be hosted in
a separate location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Several reasons. First, I may be working on something that can't be public yet,
the code may not be production level yet, maybe its a feature that I don't want
to unveil yet, maybe there are some legal reason as to why it cannot be public yet. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks only happen on Github and are entirely performed by Github. Clones are
a similar process but one that is used to move repositoies to other directories
including Github. Branches are just new lines of commits that I wish to keep separate
and code in tandem.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
